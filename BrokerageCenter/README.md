This is the hub that centralizes all communication between clients and Matching Engine. It wasinitially conceived as a way to remove unnecessary load from the Matching Engine in functions such as providing allcurrent limit order book data to newly connected clients, as well as broadcasting changes in the limit order books toclients. However, in its current implementation, its use has been expanded. It charges transaction fees (both long andshort sells), and it keeps portfolio information for all connected clients, along with their current buying power8. Thisinformation is used for account persistence and portfolio valuation, as well as assessing trading limits and margin calls.The Brokerage Center also stores permanent records of all trading data generated by the users of the exchange.
