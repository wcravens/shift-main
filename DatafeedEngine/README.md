This module works as a streamer of data to the Matching Engine when the system is running in replay mode. It requests and stores historical quoting and trading data from a market data provider, by implementing the necessary API (application programming interface). Replay mode may be used to test single-user trading strategies with historical data, or to provide liquidity in a multi-user environment (e.g., artificial agents or students in a classroom).
