As it is the case for all its real market counterparts, this module is the brain of our exchange. It is responsible for managing the limit order book (LOB) of all of the platformâ€™s traded assets, implementing the dynamics of an order driven market. The matching engine manages a local LOB, containing only orders from the clients that are connected to the platform, for each ticker. It also maintains a global LOB, which functions as the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) system specific to U.S. markets. The Matching Engine automatically routes orders from the local LOB to the global LOB whenever a better price may be obtained in an outside exchange.
